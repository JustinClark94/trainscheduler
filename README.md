This homework was relatively easy. The hardest part was trying to figure out Moment.js and doing the caluclations to to 
find the time away.

However, I did get firebase to work which was something that I had a really hard time with in class.

Beside moment js, everything else works. When you type in the Train Name, Destination, First Train Time, and Frequency, it 
stores to firebase and appends to the to the table. 

Again, I need to figure out the calculations for moment .js.
